#Guide to Contributing

## Team values
- Individual tasks should be assigned at start of each sprint.
- Team members may freely solicit help via the Slack/Discord channel, or at a Standup
- Team members are expected not to go two or more Standups without making progress

## Conflict resolution
- Team members that fall behind should clearly communicate reasons for being unable to make progress
   - Agreement that team members that fail to make progress for two or more Standups without communication will be reported to management
- Team members are encouraged to express when they have differing opinions in direction via Slack or at a Standup
   - If these differences are incompatable with other team members' opinions in direction, an effort for compromise is encouraged
   - If differences are truly unable to be resolved, the team will defer to the project owner. This is encouraged to be used as a last resort of resolving a conflict.

## Scrum Guidelines
- Sprint Period of 2 Weeks
- Standups Every 2-3 Days, expected to take 10-30 minutes

## Coding Standards
- Specific editos/environments TBD as work on project progresses
- Always pull before pushing code to main
- Push working code regularly, and make granular commits to working branches
- Don't leave dead code (with no intention of being recycled later) behind in the project
- Use descriptive comments-the function of a piece of code should not be ambiguous
- Write using descriptive variable and function names
