# \#define var "Game" 
## DVG

## Project Vision
Building and playing games is an exciting hobby that is enjoyed by many. However, currently the bar to creating multiplayer games and sharing them with friends is very high, in terms of the technical skills required. That's why we started work on DVG: to make it easier to create and share online multiplayer games with others. 

The Minimum Viable Product would be a service that allows users to upload games and save games they have created, and to allow multiple users to connect to interact with these games. Additionally features that would greatly enhance the product include a tagging and rating system to find games, and comment and forum system to build a community and make it easier to connect with others playing these games, support for running games online instead of locally and tools to help devlopers create games for the platform.
